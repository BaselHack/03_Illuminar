Light Sensor Control


# About
Sometimes you need a light switch on places you dont want it to be visible or places where you can't touch with your hands.
Thats why we developed this proyject to control a light, or any other device, with gestures, a small Ir sensor connected to an Arduino chip.

# How to use it
swipe over the sensor with your hand to turn on/off the light.
To dim the light; hold your hand over the sensor and after 1/2 Second, the system will enter dim mode. then you can cahnge the distance to the sensor to dim the light; to store the disired vlaue, just swipe out of the sensor area.
